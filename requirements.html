			<h2><b> Requirements </b></h2>
				<p> Requirements differe by state but they have the same cause, to make sure people have the capability to drive. Here are some driving requirements: </p>
				<li> non-citizens need a U.S. driver's license when visiting or temporarily living in the United States and how to contact the Department of Motor Vehicles in each state</li>
				<li>People who drive in the U.S. must have a valid driver's license. Some states require an International Driving Permit (IDP) from foreign nationals, in addition to a valid license from your own country. Contact the motor vehicle department of each state you will drive in for its requirements.  </li>
				<li>The United States does not issue IDPs to foreign visitors. To get an IDP, contact the motor vehicle department of the country that issued your driver's license. </li>
				<li>If you want to rent a car, you may need both your license and an IDP. Find out the rental company's policies and other requirements in advance. </li>
				<li>If you are eligible to apply for a driver's license, you must get a driver's license from the state where you live. </li>
				<li>A U.S. driver's license allows you to drive anywhere in the U.S. It is your responsibility to know and obey the laws of the state where you are driving.</li>
				<li> Drive sobre and Drug-free.</li>
