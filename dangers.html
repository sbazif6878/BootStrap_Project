		<h1><b><u>Dangers of Driving</u></b></h1>
		<h2> Reckless Driving</h2>
		<li>Reckless driving is often defined as a mental state in which the driver displays a wanton disregard for the rules of the road; the driver misjudges common driving procedures, often causing wrecks, accidents and other damages.</li>
		<li>In United States law, reckless driving is a major moving traffic violation. It is usually a more serious offense than careless driving, improper driving, or driving without due care and attention</li>
		<li>Is often punishable by fines, imprisonment, or driver's license suspension or revocation. </li>
		
		<h2> Statistics</h2>
		<li> Motor vehicle crashes are currently the leading cause of death for U.S. teens. In 2010, seven teens ages 16 to 19 died every day from motor vehicle injuries. </li>
		<li> Young people ages 15-24 represent only 14% of the U.S. population, yet they account for 30% ($19 billion) of the total costs of motor vehicle injuries among females. The motor vehicle death rate for male drivers and passengers ages 16 to 19 was almost two times that of their female counterparts. </li>
		<li> Among male drivers between the ages of 15 to 20 years old who were involved in fatal crashes in 2010, 39% were speeding at the time of the crash and 25% had been drinking. At all levels of blood alcohol concentration, the risk of involvement in a motor vehicle crash is greater for teens than for older drivers. In 2010, 22% of drivers aged 15 to 20 involved in fatal motor vehicle crashes were drinking. In a national survey conducted in 2011, 24% of teens reported that, within the previous month, they had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol and 8% reported having driven after drinking alcohol within the same one-month period. </li>
		<li> Road crashing is another danger of driving. Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day.</li>
		<li> An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44. Road traffic crashes rank as the 9th leading cause of death and account for 2.2% of all deaths globally.</li>
		<li>Road crashes are the leading cause of death among young people ages 15-29, and the second leading cause of death worldwide among young people ages 5-14. Each year nearly 400,000 people under 25 die on the world's roads, on average over 1,000 a day.</li>
		
		<h2>Drunk Driving and Drug Use</h2>
		<li>In 2016, 10,497 people died in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, accounting for 28% of all traffic-related deaths in the United States.</li>
		<li>Of the 1,233 traffic deaths among children ages 0 to 14 years in 2016, 214 (17%) involved an alcohol-impaired driver.</li>
		<li>The Breathalyzer determines how drunk a person is driving. In every state, it’s illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08% or more. But everyone absorbs and metabolizes alcohol at different rates, and there are lots of factors that affect BAC. </li>
		<li>Drugs other than alcohol (legal and illegal) are involved in about 16% of motor vehicle crashes.</li>
		<li>Marijuana use is increasing and 13% of nighttime, weekend drivers have marijuana in their system.Marijuana users were about 25% more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers with no evidence of marijuana use, however other factors–such as age and gender–may account for the increased crash risk among marijuana users.</li>
