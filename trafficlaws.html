<h1>Traffic Laws</h1>
	
	<h1>Laws for All States</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>Vehicles drive on the right side of the road.</li>
	
		<li>This might feel odd, especially at intersections and turn lanes if you're used to driving on the left side of the road.</li>
		
	<li>Steering wheels are on the left side of the car.</li>
	
	<li>When making a left hand turn, pass in front of cars making similar left hand turns across the intersection.</li>
	
		<li>Do not try to pass behind cars turning across from you.</li>
		
	<li>White lines are used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.</li>
	
	<li>Yellow lines are used to separate traffic headed in opposite directions.</li>
	
		<li>Do NOT cross into lanes separated by lines that are solid yellow.</li>
		
		<li>If the yellow line is broken, cross/pass with caution, but be highly aware of oncoming traffic.</li>
		
	<li>If you're behind a school bus with flashing red lights, you may NOT pass it until the lights have stopped flashing.</li>
	
	<li>Carpool/HOV lanes are typically located on the far left side of U.S. freeways.</li>
	
	<li>Pedestrians always have the legal right of way.</li>
	
		<li>If you see someone crossing the street, you must come to a full stop for them.</li>
		
	<li>Keep a careful eye out for motorcyclists and bicyclists.</li>
	
		<li>Double check all of your mirrors and blind spots before making lane changes.</li>
		
		<li>In some states, bicyclists are required to ride in the street; while some cities have designated bike lines, others do not. Be aware of your surroundings.</p>
		
	<li>Car horns should be used sparingly and only if you fear someone putting you in danger.</li>
	
		<li>If you use the horn excessively, people could get upset at you and try to retaliate.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>Safety Laws</h2>
	<ul>
	
	<li>Always wear your seatbelt.</li>
	
	<li>If you have children, make sure that they're buckled in correctly before you begin to drive.</li>
	
	<li>Children under a certain age or weight may be required to sit in a child safety seat or booster seat.</li>
	
	<li>Never drink and drive.</li>
	
	<li>It is illegal in all states to drive while legally intoxicated.</li>
	
	<li>Don't text and drive.</li>
	
	<li>In many states, texting and driving is illegal. Some prohibit the use of handheld devices for any reason, including for phone calls or navigation.</li>
	
	<li>Always use your turn signals.</li>
	
	<li>Even if it seems like there's no one around you, always signal before you turn or make lane changes.</li>
	
	<li>On freeways and highways, slower traffic generally stays in the right-hand lanes, while faster drivers stick to the left-hand lanes.</li>
	
	<li>Hitchhiking is prohibited in most states, and can be very dangerousâ€”do not attempt it, and do not pick anyone up.</li>
