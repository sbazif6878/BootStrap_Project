			<h2><b> To Start and Stop </b></h2>
				<p>Make sure the handbrake or park brake is on – with push button handbrakes, look for the dashboard light (usually a red exclamation mark “!” in a red circle).Make sure the gearbox is in neutral for a manual car or park for an automatic car.
					Press the clutch pedal with the left foot (if the car is manual).Press the brake pedal with the right foot (automatic and manual cars).If the car has a key, turn the key to start the engine and let go as soon as the engine has started. If you are driving a very old car (perhaps pre-1980s) you may have to give the car some choke if it’s cold.
					If the car has push button ignition, push the button for long enough for the engine to start.Check the gauges and warning lights as the vehicle goes through its initial post-start check. All warning lights should extinguish, unless there’s one warning the engine is still cold.</p><br>
					
				<p> You should consider all safety risks before performing any basic maintenance or repair on your car. First, make sure that small children are in a safe area away from the engine while you are establishing how to jump a dead car battery. Take a moment to read the manual of your car. Some vehicles require extra steps in order to have a successful jump. If you’re unsure of what to do, contact your local Meineke Car Care Center for advice. Assuming that your car will permit a jump, you should be careful to prevent dangerous electric shocks. When you handle the jumper cables, be aware that their function is to transmit electrical current from one car to another. Once one end of the jumper cables is connected to a car, do not touch the metal clamps to anything but the appropriate target. It’s also recommended that you wear a pair of protective glasses in case sparks go flying into the air.</p><br>
				
				<p>f the jump fails to start your car after a few short attempts, or if the car starts but then dies again, you have some other issues you need to address. Most batteries are rated to last 4-6 years. If your battery is old, you may need to replace it. If the battery should be working well, you should consider other possible problems with other components, including:fuses, battery corrosion, faulty alternator, ignition switch, starter connection. When you do not know what is wrong, your best bet is to take the car in to your local Meineke Car Care Center for service and repair.  Many centers conveniently offer free battery inspections and diagnostic scans and can help you understand your vehicle’s issues.Dealing with a dead car battery is a pain. Luckily, getting your car working again is not terribly difficult. By following these instructions, using your jumper cables sensibly, practicing safety and addressing other potential concerns, your car will run better, be safer, and last longer. </p><br>

			<h2><b> Parking </b></h2><br>
				
				
				<h3><b> Parallel Parking</b></h3>
				<p>Drive around until you find a spot that looks big enough.Pull up even to the front car. If your cars are different lengths, line up the back of your car with the back of the front car as best you can. You don't have to be exact here.Stop.While stopped, turn your wheel all the way to the right. All the way. Don't move forward or back while doing this! Turn around and look out the back of your car.Begin backing up. Your car should start turning into the spot. Don't turn your wheel away from the all-the-way-right position!Stop backing up when the right-front corner of the rear car is in the exact middle of your rear windshield. If you imagine a line extending backwards from your car along its centerline, you stop when the right-front corner of the rear car reaches that line.I said STOP.While stopped, turn your wheel back to the middle position.Back up slowly until your car just barely clears the front car, then stop again.STOP.Turn your wheel all the way to the left. All the way! Stay stopped while you do this.Now keep backing in. Don't turn your wheel away from the all-the-way-left position!Once your car is parallel, STOP and then turn your wheel to face forwards again.</p><br>
				
				<h3><b>Between two cars or lines</b></h3>
				<p>Compared to navigating a parallel parking space, parking your car between two other cars in a standard parking space is relatively simple. There are two types of standard parking spaces. You will likely encounter both straight parking spaces and diagonal parking spaces in your driving career. There is a small difference in parking techniques when we deal with straight parking spaces. Before you park your car, you must locate an open parking space. There are several aspects of an ideal parking spot.Make sure that the cars parked on either side of the open parking space are aligned within their own parks and not situated too close to the perimeter of the open space. If parking in an open parking lot at night, try to find a parking space that is in close proximity to a light for added safety.If parking in the parking lot of a retail store, try to locate an open parking space that is away from shopping cart collectors or groups of unattended shopping carts. This will help prevent your vehicle from being damaged while parked in a parking lot.Although convenience is important, parking midway down an aisle of parking spaces is often better than parking in a space close to the beginning of an aisle. Your vehicle will be less likely to be totally surrounded by other vehicles and there will be less traffic when you enter and exit the space.</p><br>
